## Primary Objective
Derived from the concept of Candy Crush and Bejeweled, Airport Bunches of Fun has players match groups of identical icons to reach score goals and proceed to higher levels.

## How to Win
Airport Bunches of Fun is a score-based game, so players compete for the highest score, but no player loses. Players gain points for matching groups of similar icons. The more icons popped with one click, the greater their value. Once the timer runs out, players may record their two-letter initials with their score.

## Detailed Description
Starting the game, the scoreboard, timer, playing field, and sponsor box appear on the screen. Sponsor icon tokens fall from the top of the screen into the playing area until the field is full. A large “Go!” message appears in the center of the screen, starting the timer and allowing players to begin. Clicking adjacent, matching tokens pops them, increases the player’s score, and drops the rows of tokens above them into place. The more icons popped in a single click; the greater points value the player receives. Once a level’s points ceiling is reached, a new level loads, refreshes the playing field, and increases the amount of time the player has by the remaining time from the previous level. Once the time runs out, players may record their scores with their two-letter initials.

## Gameplay
- Players click sponsor-labelled tokens in matching groups to pop them and earn points.
- Groups of three or more tokens are required to register points.
- Tokens beyond three matches add bonus points.
- Occasional powerup items appear on the playing field to clear tokens from the field.
    - Toys (cars and dolls) – Wipe an X pattern from the field
    - Chicken nuggets – 2x3 grid wipe
    - Book – Swap random blocks with random powerups
    - Ice cream cone – Vertical wipe
    - Pretzel – Horizontal wipe
    - Apple Slices – Change surrounding tokens to a random, single color
- Reaching the level points ceiling progresses the player to the next level, resetting the playing field and incrementing the timer by the time remaining.
    - The timer cannot exceed 120 seconds, less two seconds per level achieved.
- The game ends when the timer reaches zero seconds, providing players the opportunity to record their score.
